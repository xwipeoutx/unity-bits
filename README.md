This repository contains snippets and examples of helpful effects and scripts I've used.

## Texture Reveal

Simple effect to transition between alpha=0 and alpha=1 with a cool blend.  Good for revealing panels or terrain layers, for example.

Shader can be found at `UnityHelpers/Assets/Hydration Shader/Reveal.shader`

See `UnityHelpers/Assets/Sweep/Example/Hydration Sample Scene` for an example.
